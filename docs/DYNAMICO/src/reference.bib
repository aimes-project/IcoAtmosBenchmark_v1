abstract = { AbstractThe curl form of equations of inviscid atmospheric motion in general non-Eulerian coordinates is obtained. Narrowing down to a general vertical coordinate, a quasi-Hamiltonian form is then obtained in a Lagrangian, isentropic, mass-based or z-based vertical coordinate. In non-Lagrangian vertical coordinates, the conservation of energy by the vertical transport terms results from the invariance of energy under the vertical relabeling of fluid parcels. A complete or partial separation between the horizontal and vertical dynamics is achieved, except in the Eulerian case. The horizontal–vertical separation is especially helpful for (quasi-)hydrostatic systems characterized by vanishing vertical momentum. Indeed for such systems vertical momentum balance reduces to a simple statement: total energy is stationary with respect to adiabatic vertical displacements of fluid parcels. From this point of view the purpose of (quasi-)hydrostatic balance is to determine the vertical positions of fluid parcels, for which no evolution equation is readily available. This physically appealing formulation significantly extends previous work.The general formalism is exemplified for the fully compressible Euler equations in a Lagrangian vertical coordinate and a Cartesian (x, z) slice geometry, and the deep-atmosphere quasi-hydrostatic equations in latitude–longitude horizontal coordinates. The latter case, in particular, illuminates how the apparent intricacy of the time-dependent metric terms and of the additional forces can be absorbed into a proper choice of prognostic variables. In both cases it is shown how the quasi-Hamiltonian form leads straightforwardly to the conservation of energy using only integration by parts.Relationships with previous work and implications for stability analysis and the derivation of approximate sets of equations and energy-conserving numerical schemes are discussed. }

abstract = { AbstractThe usual geophysical approximations are reframed within a variational framework. Starting from the Lagrangian of the fully compressible Euler equations expressed in a general curvilinear coordinates system, Hamilton’s principle of least action yields Euler?Lagrange equations of motion. Instead of directly making approximations in these equations, the approach followed is that of Hamilton’s principle asymptotics; that is, all approximations are performed in the Lagrangian. Using a coordinate system where the geopotential is the third coordinate, diverse approximations are considered. The assumptions and approximations covered are 1) particular shapes of the geopotential; 2) shallowness of the atmosphere, which allows for the approximation of the relative and planetary kinetic energy; 3) small vertical velocities, implying quasi-hydrostatic systems; and 4) pseudoincompressibility, enforced by introducing a Lagangian multiplier.This variational approach greatly facilitates the derivation of the equations and systematically ensures their dynamical consistency. Indeed, the symmetry properties of the approximated Lagrangian imply the conservation of energy, potential vorticity, and momentum. Justification of the equations then relies, as usual, on a proper order-of-magnitude analysis. As an illustrative example, the asymptotic consistency of recently introduced shallow-atmosphere equations with a complete Coriolis force is discussed, suggesting additional corrections to the pressure gradient and gravity. }
