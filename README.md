# IcoAtmosBenchmark v1 (kernels)

This is the benchmark suite of computational kernels from icosahedral atmospheric model.



# Quick Start

The kernels are located at the directories

```
(/kernels/ICON/*)
(/kernels/DYNAMICO/*)
 /kernels/NICAM/*
```

individually. Please see QuickStart.md in these directories.
Each kernel has source code (src), input and reference data (data), and sample script for the execution (run).
You can build each kernel individually. You can build all kernels at once, by making at /kernels.
