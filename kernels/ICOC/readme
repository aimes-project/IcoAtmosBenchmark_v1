To run the test code the code should be compiled with MPI and NetCDF support.
The values GVAL, NBRS, and BLKSIZE should be defined to compile the source code, GVAL can be either float or double, NBRS should be 3 to run the application on a triangular icosahedral grid, and BLKSIZE is the value used for blocking.

To run the code remember that it is an MPI application, so use the right way to launch it on the test machine.
The command line takes some parameters that specify the grid size, time-steps, I/O files.

Within the directory is a shell script 'run' that compiles the code and runs it.

In the folder is also the source code (in tools folder) of a tool to generate initial values for the test application to test I/O. To compile the tool you should define the values GVAL, NBRS, and BLKSIZE.
After compiling this tool, you can run it to generate the initial values of the field gv_temp. To do this the grid size and the name of the NetCDF file that the tool will generate should be given as parameters.
You can run the shell script 'CreateInputNetCDF' to generate the input file.
